Deep Learning:
     Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled.
    Various Activation Functions:
       *Ridge activation functions.
       *Radial activation functions.
       *Folding activation functions.
